# Module-Current-Probe
Simple current probe pcb for use with eurorack and motm synthesizer modules. 

Makes it easy to place a current meter in series with power headers. Also makes it easy to power a module with a current-limited lab power-supply. Make sure to jump any power rails which are not in use. 

Currently there are 2 versions. V1 - for eurorack modules only and V2 - for eurorack and motm modules.

V1
